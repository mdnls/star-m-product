# star-m-product
The tensor star-m product is a matrix mimetic binary operation on tensor spaces. It induces an SVD, Eckart-Young type guarantees, and other useful linear algebraic tools which can replace their matrix counterparts for data with a natural tensor structure. This repository is a Python implementation with various related experiments.
